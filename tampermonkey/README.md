# Tampermonkey Scripts

## Force See Podfic

Many thanks to [GodOfLaundryBaskets' See Podfic First script](https://github.com/godoflaundry/fandom-scripts/tree/master/tapermonkey) for inspiring this.

Shows the "Works inspired by this one" section at the top of a work and includes any related works the author has not approved the link to. Click on [this link](https://github.com/sunkitten-shash/fandom-scripts/raw/main/tampermonkey/force-see-podfic.pub.user.js) to install the script.

Other notes: Will remove the note about seeing the end of the work for other works inspired by this one, but will keep the link for more notes at the end of the work. In multichapter works, the links to related works will appear at the top of every chapter.

## Average Chapter Length

Adds an estimated average chapter length to the stats of each work on a works list. Note that it will show regardless of whether the fic has multiple chapters or not. Click on [this link](https://github.com/sunkitten-shash/fandom-scripts/raw/main/tampermonkey/avg-chapter-len.pub.user.js) to install the script.

(Possible future improvements include actually fetching the wordcount of each chapter for calculations - slightly more accurate but also a lot more resource-intensive.)
